# bird
This a django app that does stuff with #TenMinMerlin data. If you're not up on #TenMinMerlin, it is when you have the Merlin phone app listen to the outside world for 10 minutes and let it identify all the birds it hears. Using this web app you can collect data over time and have fun visualizations, etc.
